      "\u001b[34mQ1. You have been engaged by a company to design and lead the migration to an aws environment. an argument has broken out about how to meet future backup & archive requirements and how to transition. the security manager and cto are concerned about backup continuity and the ability to continue to access old tape archives. the senior engineer is adamant that there is no way to retain the old backup solution in the aws environment, and that they will lose access to all the current archives. what information can you share that will satisfy both parties in a cost-effective manner?- Meet with the management team and explain that the senior engineer is correct: there is no mechanism for retaining the existing backup/archive solution as the aws data centers are closed facilities.x Meet with both parties and brief them on the aws storage gateway vtl solution. explain that it can initially be installed in the on-premises environment utilizing the existing enterprise backup product to start the transition without losing access to the existing backups and archives. over the duration of the migration, most (if not all) the backup cycles will be replaced by the new vtl & vts tapes.- Propose that after transition access to archive tapes could be managed via a 3rd party service provider for the odd occasion that a historical archive is required.- Suggest that in order to maintain access to the existing archives, after transition a aws storage gateway solution could be commissioned in a partner data center using the existing equipment.x Suggest that during transition, a second aws storage gateway vtl solution could be commissioned in the customer's new vpc and integrated with existing vts. at the same time, the existing enterprise backup solution could be used to perform tape-to-tape copies to migrate the archives from tape to vtl/vts virtual tape.- Propose using the aws import/export service to import the contents of the backup and archive tapes into s3/glacier to preserve them in case they are required later.\u001b[0m\n"
