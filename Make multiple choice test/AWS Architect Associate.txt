####Q1. A client is concerned that someone other than approved administrators is trying to gain access to the linux web app instances in their vpc. she asks what sort of network access logging can be added. which of the following might you recommend?- Use event log filters to trigger alerts that are forwarded to cloudwatch.x Set up a flow log for the group of instances and forward them to s3.x Set up a flow log for the group of instances and forward them to cloudwatch.x Flow logs can be set up for a vpc, subnet, or individual network interface. the data can be published to cloudwatch logs or amazon s3.- Set up a traffic logging rule on the network firewall and direct the log to cloudwatch or s3.

####Q2. You work for a large software company in seattle. they have their production environment provisioned on aws inside a custom vpc. the vpc contains both a public and private subnet. the company tests their applications on custom ec2 instances inside a private subnet. there are approximately 500 instances, and they communicate to the outside world via a proxy server. at 3am every night, the ec2 instances pull down os updates, which are usually 150mb or so. they then apply these updates and reboot: if the software has not downloaded within half an hour, then the update will attempt to download the following day. you notice that a number of ec2 instances are continually failing to download the updates in the allotted time. which of the following answers might explain this failure?- The proxy server has an inadequately sized ebs volume attached to it. the network buffer is stored on the ebs volume, and it is running out of disk space when trying to buffer the 500 simultaneous connections. you should provision an ebs volume with provisioned iops.- The proxy server has only one elastic ip address added to it. to increase network throughput, you should add additional elastic ip addresses.x The proxy server is in a private subnet and uses a nat instance to connect to the internet. however, this instance is too small to handle the required network traffic. you should re-provision the nat solution so that it's able to handle the throughput.- Your proxy server is blacklisting the address from which the updates are being downloaded, resulting in failed downloads.x The proxy server is on an inadequately sized ec2 instance and does not have sufficient network throughput to handle all updates simultaneously. you should increase the instance size or type of the ec2 instance for the proxy server.

####Q5. You run a meme creation website that stores the original images in s3 and each meme's metadata in dynamodb. you need to decide upon a low-cost storage option for the memes, themselves. if a meme object is unavailable or lost, a lambda function will automatically recreate it but at a $10 licensing cost per creation. there is a very large number of files, and they require rapid access when needed. which storage solution should you use to store the memes in a cost effective way that guards against the possibility of high license fees?- S3 - onezone-iax S3 - ia- S3 - rrs- S3- Glacier

You are a solutions architect working for a large anti-virus company and your job is to secure your companyâ€™s production aws environment. a new policy dictates that a particular public-facing subnet needs to allow rdp on port 3389 at the network acl layer. you create an inbound rule allowing traffic to port 3389 on the acl level. however, users complain that they still cannot connect. which of the following answers may represent the root cause of the connectivity issues?- Updates to network access control lists can take time to propagate.- Network access control lists are stateful.x Network access control lists are stateless.x You need to create an outbound rule allowing rdp response traffic to go back out again.

####Q8. You are a consultant planning to deploy dynamodb across three azs. your lead dba is concerned about data consistency. which of the following do you advise the lead dba to do?- To ask the development team to code for strongly consistent reads, as it will impact the read times slightly, but not the throughput capacity.- To ask the development team to code to check for a successful completion code (200) at the completion of every write.- To ask the development team to implement a checksum algorithm to confirm that the data is consistent across all the azs.x To ask the development team to code for strongly consistent reads. as the consultant, you will advise the cto it may have higher latency than eventually consistent reads.- To ask the development team to code a lambda function to check data consistency after each write.- To ask the development team to code an maintenance task to run on a schedule to check consistency.

####Q10. Your company provides an online image recognition service and uses sqs to decouple system components. your ec2 instances poll the image queue as often as possible to keep end-to-end throughput as high as possible, but you realize that all this polling is resulting in both a large number of cpu cycles and skyrocketing costs. how can you reduce cost without compromising service?- Enable short polling by setting the receivemessagewaittimeminutes to a number > 0.- Enable long polling by setting the receivemessagewaittimeminutes to a number > 0.x Enable long polling by setting the receivemessagewaittimeseconds to a number > 0.- Enable short polling by setting the receivemessagewaittimeseconds to a number > 0.

####Q12. When coding a routine to upload to s3, you have the option of using either single part upload or multipart upload. identify all the possible reasons below to use multipart upload.- Multipart upload delivers improved security in transit.x Multipart upload delivers the ability to begin an upload before you know the final object size.- Multipart upload delivers the ability to append data into an open data file.x Multipart upload delivers quick recovery from network issues.x Multipart upload delivers the ability to pause and resume object uploads.x Multipart upload delivers improved throughput.

####Q13. You have been engaged by a company to design and lead the migration to an aws environment. an argument has broken out about how to meet future backup & archive requirements and how to transition. the security manager and cto are concerned about backup continuity and the ability to continue to access old tape archives. the senior engineer is adamant that there is no way to retain the old backup solution in the aws environment, and that they will lose access to all the current archives. what information can you share that will satisfy both parties in a cost-effective manner?- Meet with the management team and explain that the senior engineer is correct: there is no mechanism for retaining the existing backup/archive solution as the aws data centers are closed facilities.x Meet with both parties and brief them on the aws storage gateway vtl solution. explain that it can initially be installed in the on-premises environment utilizing the existing enterprise backup product to start the transition without losing access to the existing backups and archives. over the duration of the migration, most (if not all) the backup cycles will be replaced by the new vtl & vts tapes.- Propose that after transition access to archive tapes could be managed via a 3rd party service provider for the odd occasion that a historical archive is required.- Suggest that in order to maintain access to the existing archives, after transition a aws storage gateway solution could be commissioned in a partner data center using the existing equipment.x Suggest that during transition, a second aws storage gateway vtl solution could be commissioned in the customer's new vpc and integrated with existing vts. at the same time, the existing enterprise backup solution could be used to perform tape-to-tape copies to migrate the archives from tape to vtl/vts virtual tape.- Propose using the aws import/export service to import the contents of the backup and archive tapes into s3/glacier to preserve them in case they are required later.
